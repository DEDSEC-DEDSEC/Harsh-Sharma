     <h3>Basketball</h3>
     <p>
        The sport of basketball is known as a fun past time for any person young or old. Basketball is a great way of exercise and a great way to have fun with friends and possibly make some new ones. I love to watch and play the game, basketball is a very entertaining sport and can be played by anyone.

       <h3>Listening Music</h3>
       <p>
        Music is the best way to be happy and busy in life. In this busy, crowded and corrupt world, where everyone wants to harm each other at all times, music keeps us happy during these difficult times and helps to provide relief to our brain.

       <h3>Sketching</h3>
       <p>
        One of the major reasons why I love sketching because it gives me wings to fly. I can draw anything which is in my mind. I can express my thoughts through sketching. I can speak through my drawing and painting without uttering a word.

       <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>
            Book reading is a noble habit that everyone should have. A book can give you a good time as your friend. They never leave and stay with you at every moment of your life. A good book can be a life-changing motto. Maybe you will take the suggestion seriously from a book that you wonâ€™t take seriously from a normal person. To build a book reading habit, you need to become patient. But when you will start feeling the real pleasure of reading then you will keep reading more and more books yourself.
